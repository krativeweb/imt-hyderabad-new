                  PPT is an ideal platform for interaction between corporate
                  fraternity and students. The recruiters share their company’s
                  vision, work culture and opportunities available at Management
                  Trainee and middle management levels. This is then followed by
                  a detailed Q&A session to help the students gain deeper
                  understanding about the organization and role offered.

                  Application
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The interested students apply to the organization through the
                  placement office. As part of application, they submit their
                  detailed resume which is then shared with the organization by
                  the placement office.

                  Placement Interviews
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The recruiters shortlist candidates for either GD rounds or
                  Personal Interview rounds depending on the organization’s
                  recruitment policy. This gives organizations and students an
                  excellent opportunity to interact with each other and
                  understand the role and profile in detail.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Once the final interview round is conducted, the company makes
                  a firm offer to the candidate. The offer should include
                  regular details such as job role, compensation package,
                  location and other terms and conditions required by the
                  candidate to make a further decision.

                  Pre-Placement Offer
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Students receiving Pre-Placement Offers with a salary greater
                  than the previous year’s average campus placement salary will
                  not be considered in the placement process. Students with PPOs
                  less than this salary, if they wish to, will be allowed to sit
                  in the campus placement process, provided they have formally
                  rejected the PPO and marked a copy to the Head of Placements.
                  Once a PPO has been accepted by the student, they will be
                  automatically removed from the placement process.

                  SCOP at IMT Hyderabad abbreviates as “Student Committee of
                  Placements” and is an integral part of the Placements Team.
                  The committee acts as a bridge between the students and the
                  Corporate Relations Group, and between the Institute and
                  corporates through campus engagement activities like
                  leadership series, practitioner sessions, and pre-placement
                  talks. The committee is responsible for the smooth conduction
                  of summer and final placement processes across both batches.
                  In addition, SCOP is entrusted with framing placement
                  guidelines and ensuring the best possible fit between students
                  and job opportunities. The Student Committee of Placements
                  works under the motto:{" "}
                  <strong>“One for all and All for one.”</strong>
